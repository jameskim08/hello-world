A practice exercise to learn how to use GitHub

Hi, my name is James and I am interested in front-end and back-end development. I have worked in the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee in my last co-op term and am now working at Rogers Communications.

The programming languages and tools I currently have experience with are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQeury, AJAX, JSON, Git, Java, XML, C++, SQL, Linux, and AutoIt.
