A practice exercise to learn how to use GitHub

Hi! My name is James and I'm currently learning how to do Front-End Development as well as Android!
I am currently working on my personal website and I plan on making a simple game on Android.

The programming languages and tools I currently have experience with are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQeury, AJAX, JSON, Git, Java, XML, C++, SQL, Linux, and AutoIt.
